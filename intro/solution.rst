Hi,
I am Sonam Banerjee,a second year b.Tech student of Computer Science Engineering,studying in Dr. B. C. Roy Engg College, Durgapur.
Presently, I am undergoing summer trainning on Python program being conducted by Mr. Kushal Das. I am finding this trainning very interesting and useful for our ongoing studies. In the process, I am also getting an orientation in linux. I hope this trainning will help me immensely to understand a lot of issues regarding Python and will brush up my programming knowledge.
Thanks and regards.
